Run `0.build.r` from the `sociothese` folder to replicate the model and plots. The script sets a few model parameters and estimate LDA models on summaries that match `relig*`, and then on the full dataset, which takes around four hours to fully estimate and diagnose on a recent MacBook Air.

The functions come from [Gr√ºn and Hornik 2011](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i13) or from [this example](https://github.com/qxde01/myRproj/tree/master/CloudAtlas) (in Japanese).
